Project Overview

This project explores how personality impacts job performance, with the goal of helping CARICON improve candidate–role matching. Using machine learning methods like classification and supervised learning, we will build models to:
	•	Group people by personality traits.
	•	Predict job performance based on personality.
	•	Provide insights that can support hiring and team alignment.

A successful outcome would be a working prototype that:
	•	Accurately predicts job fit based on personality data.
	•	Helps CARICON streamline hiring and team placement.
	•	Offers clear, human-centered recommendations rather than automated hiring decisions.

Project Context
	•	About CARICON: CARICON promotes Caribbean literature globally by connecting authors with readers, industry professionals, and publishers.
	•	Customers: Authors, agents, publishers, producers, and those interested in Caribbean stories.
	•	Industry: Global literary/cultural sector.
	•	Stakeholders: CARICON leadership, recruiters, board members, and candidates who engage with their programs.

Success Metrics
	•	Model performance: Accuracy, F1 score, AUROC, or other suitable metrics depending on task.
	•	Business impact: Faster and easier hiring decisions, better role matching, improved retention, and stronger team dynamics.

⸻

Ethical Considerations
	•	Avoid bias against underrepresented personality types.
	•	Consider cultural factors in personality measurement.
	•	Protect sensitive applicant data.
	•	Ensure the tool assists rather than replaces human decision-making.

Repo Guide

This repo will store:
	•	Code for data preparation, modeling, and evaluation.
	•	Documentation (briefs, notes, reports).
	•	Notebooks for exploratory analysis and prototyping.

Data will not be stored directly in this repository (private storage only).

⸻

Next Steps
	•	Finalize dataset access.
	•	Set up repo structure (folders for code, data references, docs).
	•	Begin exploratory data analysis (EDA).
